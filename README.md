# Music-trends-charts

This was the code used for my final report for my Statistical Data Scinece class. The report was about the trends in music charts over the years. The data was obtained from scraping Youtube Chart and collect from spotify Chart. The data was then cleaned and analyzed to find trends in the music charts over the years.

The challenge was finding historical data of music streams but I was able to find a dataset that had the top 200 songs streamed on Spotify for the past 4 years. I also scraped the Youtube Chart for the top 100 songs for the past 4 years. The data was then cleaned and analyzed to find trends in the music charts over the years.ff
