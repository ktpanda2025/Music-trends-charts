# Music-trends-charts

This was the code used for my final report for my Statistical Data Scinece class. The report was about the trends in music charts over the years. The data was obtained from scraping Youtube Chart and collect from spotify Chart. The data was then cleaned and analyzed to find trends in the music charts over the years.

The challenge was finding historical data of music streams but I was able to find a dataset that had the top 200 songs streamed on Spotify for the past 4 years. I also scraped the Youtube Chart for the top 100 songs for the past 4 years. The data was then cleaned and analyzed to find trends in the music charts over the years.



Project Description:

- The project involves scraping data from both YouTube music charts and Spotify charts. This data is then combined to offer users insights and visualizations related to the popularity of artists and their songs. The key functionalities of the project include:

- Data Scraping: The project utilizes web scraping techniques to gather data from YouTube music charts, capturing information such as song rankings and view counts.

- Data Integration: CSV files from Spotify charts are integrated into the project, enhancing the dataset with additional information on song rankings and stream counts.

- Artist Ranking Charts: Users can generate charts that visualize the ranking of a specific artist on YouTube music charts over time. This feature provides insights into the artist's popularity and performance on the platform.

- Song Analysis: Users can explore detailed information about all the songs by a particular artist that appear in the top 100 charts. This analysis includes metrics such as the number of streams each song has received, allowing users to assess the popularity of individual songs within the artist's catalog.
